## Features

- **Smart Search** - Find any Steam game or DLC by name or App ID. Add a Steam API key in Settings for the fullest, most
  up to date results
- **Profile Management** - Keep different game lists organized with multiple profiles
- **Auto-Detection** - Automatically finds your Steam and GreenLuma folders
- **One-Click Launch** - Generate your AppList and start GreenLuma without the hassle
- **AppList.ini Support** - Uses the newer AppList.ini format on GreenLuma 1.8.0 and up, and falls back to the classic
  per-file format on older versions
- **Plugin Support** - Import, enable, disable, and remove community plugins from the Plugins menu
- **Stealth Mode** - Configure GreenLuma's injection settings for discreet operation
- **Install / Update GreenLuma** - Point the app at a GreenLuma zip file and it extracts and deploys the right files for
  Normal or Stealth mode, for a fresh install or an existing one
- **GreenLuma Update Check** - Checks the GreenLuma forum thread for a newer release than what's installed, shown as a
  status badge and a toast notification. Turns itself on or off automatically the first time it can tell whether the
  forum is reachable, then stays as you set it in Settings
- **Auto-Updates** - Keeps you up to date with the latest features and fixes
- **Auto-Start** - Option to launch with Windows and replace Steam startup

## Getting Started

### Download and Run

1. Grab the latest `GreenLuma-Manager.exe` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Double-click and run it
3. The app will auto-detect your Steam and GreenLuma paths
4. If it doesn't find them, set them manually in Settings (⚙️)

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- .NET 10.0 or higher

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3vil3vo/GreenLuma-Manager.git
   cd GreenLuma-Manager
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio**
    - Open `GreenLuma-Manager.slnx`

## How to Use

1. **First Time Setup**
    - On first launch, the app auto-detects Steam and GreenLuma paths
    - Older config files are migrated automatically
    - Adjust settings in Settings (⚙️) if needed
    - If GreenLuma reports version 1.7.9, you will see a one-time prompt asking whether it should be treated as 1.7.9 or
      1.8.0. This only happens once, and can be changed later in Settings if needed

2. **Installing or Updating GreenLuma** (optional)
    - In Settings, Advanced tab, browse for a GreenLuma zip file
    - Pick Normal or Stealth mode and click "Install / Update"
    - Works for a fresh install or refreshing an existing one, using the GreenLuma Directory set on the General tab
    - "Check GreenLuma Forum for Updates" in Settings turns itself on or off automatically the first time it can tell
      whether the forum is reachable, and can be changed anytime

3. **Finding Games**
    - Type a game name or App ID into the search box
    - Add a Steam API key in Settings to get the full, current Steam catalog. Without a key, search only uses the list
      bundled with the app
    - Click the + button to add games to your current profile

4. **Managing Profiles**
    - Select a profile from the dropdown menu
    - Create new profiles with the + button
